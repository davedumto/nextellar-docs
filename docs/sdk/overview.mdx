# Nextellar SDK — Overview

The **Nextellar SDK** is a set of client-side utilities, React hooks, and typed APIs that make interacting with the Stellar network (Horizon + Soroban) simple, reliable, and composable within Next.js applications. The SDK focuses on ergonomics, strong typing, and production-readiness so teams can build wallet-connected experiences and contract-driven features quickly.

---

## Goals

* **Developer ergonomics** — Provide small, composable hooks and helpers that do one thing well.
* **Type safety** — Ship TypeScript-first APIs with accurate typings and JSDoc for IDE autocompletion.
* **Stellar-first primitives** — Encapsulate Horizon / Soroban interactions behind intuitive abstractions such as `useStellarAccount`, `useStellarPayment`, and `useSorobanContract`.
* **Testability** — Support network mocking (MSW) and deterministic behavior for unit/integration testing.
* **Extensibility** — Keep the SDK modular so teams can replace or extend adapters (custom wallets, RPC endpoints) without forked codebases.

---

## What’s included

* **React hooks** for common flow (accounts, balances, trustlines, payments, transaction history).
* **Soroban helpers** for contract calls, fee estimation, and event subscriptions.
* **Typed clients** that wrap Horizon and Soroban RPC interactions.
* **UI primitives** (lightweight helpers) that pair well with the shadcn/ui component set in the scaffold.
* **Testing utilities** to stub Horizon/Soroban responses using MSW and helper matchers for Jest.

---

## Architecture & Patterns

1. **Client layer (`lib/stellar`)** — Creates configured instances for Horizon and Soroban RPC clients. This layer is side-effect free and test-friendly.

2. **Adapter layer** — Wallet adapters (Freighter, XBull, Ledger) expose a common shape so hooks can remain wallet-agnostic. Adapters are responsible for connection, signing operations, and public key management.

3. **Hook layer (`hooks/*`)** — Lightweight, composable React hooks built on top of the client and adapter layers. Hooks handle orchestration (caching, polling, subscriptions) and expose minimal imperative APIs where necessary (e.g., `sendPayment()`).

4. **UI helpers** — Non-visual helpers for formatting balances, parsing operations, and deriving transaction statuses.

5. **Testing utilities** — Utilities and MSW handlers that mirror real Horizon and Soroban responses for offline testing.

## Stability & Versioning

The SDK follows semantic versioning. Breaking changes will be communicated in release notes and migration guides. Public APIs in the `hooks/` and `lib/stellar/` folders are considered the stable surface; internal utilities may change more frequently.

---

## Security Considerations

* **Never expose private keys** client-side. Wallet adapters must handle signing operations securely.
* **Validate contract inputs** before constructing transactions to avoid injection or malformed transactions.
* **Rate-limit horizon requests** and handle transient errors (retry/backoff) gracefully.

## Getting started (links)

* SDK hooks reference → **[Hooks](/docs/sdk/hooks)**
* Full API reference → **[API Reference](/docs/sdk/api-reference)**

For a quick, practical start, jump to the **Hooks** page which contains runnable examples and usage patterns.

## Contributing & Roadmap

Contributions to SDK APIs, adapters, and tests are welcome. When proposing a change:

1. Open an issue describing the motivation and intended API.
2. Submit a small, focused PR with tests and typings updated.
3. Add migration notes for breaking changes.

Planned items for the SDK roadmap:

* Expanded Soroban contract examples and event helpers.
* Official MSW fixtures for Horizon & Soroban.
* A small CLI utility to generate hook and component skeletons (`nextellar generate`).
