# Welcome to **Nextellar**

## Build Stellar-Powered Applications with Speed and Confidence

Welcome to **Nextellar**, a modern developer toolchain designed to help you build Stellar-powered applications with speed, consistency, and confidence. Nextellar provides a **one-step CLI**, **opinionated scaffolding**, and **first-class Stellar integration** so you can focus on product development instead of boilerplate setup.

Whether you're building a wallet, a payment experience, a dApp, or a full-scale production application, Nextellar gives you a clean, extensible foundation powered by:

- **Next.js 16** (App Router with Turbopack)
- **TypeScript 5**
- **React 19**
- **Stellar SDK** and **Stellar Wallets Kit**
- **Tailwind CSS 4**
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Zustand** for state management
- **8 Production-Ready React Hooks**

Nextellar reduces the time developers spend configuring tools, managing dependencies, and wiring up blockchain integrations. With a single command, you're ready to build.
