# Hooks Overview

Nextellar provides a set of powerful, typed React hooks that simplify working with Stellar accounts, balances, payments, smart contracts, wallets, and DEX data. These hooks are lightweight, composable, and designed to fit naturally into modern Next.js applications.

---

## Why Hooks in Nextellar?

### Reactive Stellar data

Live updates for accounts, balances, transactions, and contract values.

### Cleaner UI components

Hooks keep UI components free from networking and blockchain logic.

### Built-in loading & error states

Every hook exposes a consistent, predictable return shape.

### Full TypeScript support

Strong types for Stellar responses ensure correctness and better DX.

### Auto-consume provider config

Hooks automatically use `WalletProvider` settings when available.

---

## Available Hooks

Below is the complete list of hooks included in Nextellar projects.

---

## **Wallet & Account Hooks**

### [useStellarWallet](/docs/hooks/use-stellar-wallet)

Complete wallet connection and account management. Supports multi-wallet (Freighter, Albedo, Lobstr, xBull, Hana), auto-reconnect, balance fetching, and payment sending.

### [useStellarBalances](/docs/hooks/use-stellar-balances)

Fetch and track XLM and custom asset balances with optional polling. Handles unfunded accounts gracefully.

### [useTrustlines](/docs/hooks/use-trustlines)

Manage asset trustlines - query existing trustlines and build change-trust transactions for wallet signing.

### [useTransactionHistory](/docs/hooks/use-transaction-history)

Load and paginate account transaction/operation history with cursor-based pagination.

---

## **Transaction Hooks**

### [useStellarPayment](/docs/hooks/use-stellar-payment)

Build and submit Stellar payment transactions. Provides XDR building for wallet signing and dev-only secret key methods.

### [useOfferBook](/docs/hooks/use-offer-book)

Query Stellar DEX orderbook data for asset pairs (bids/asks) with optional polling.

---

## **Soroban (Smart Contract) Hooks**

### [useSorobanContract](/docs/hooks/use-soroban-contract)

Interact with Soroban smart contracts. Read contract state via simulation and build invoke transactions for signing.

### [useSorobanEvents](/docs/hooks/use-soroban-events)

Subscribe to Soroban contract events with cursor-based pagination and optional polling.

---

## How Nextellar Hooks Work

Nextellar's hooks are designed to stay out of your way and let you build fast. Each hook sits on top of the Stellar SDK and wallet adapters, turning complex blockchain logic into simple, predictable React APIs.

### Auto-Consume Pattern

All hooks automatically consume configuration from `WalletProvider` when available:

```tsx
// Provider sets global config
<WalletProvider horizonUrl="https://horizon.stellar.org">
  <App />
</WalletProvider>;

// Hooks auto-consume the horizonUrl
function MyComponent() {
  const { balances } = useStellarBalances(publicKey);
  // Uses mainnet automatically!
}
```

### Override Per-Component

You can always override the provider config:

```tsx
const { balances } = useStellarBalances(publicKey, {
  horizonUrl: 'https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org',
});
```

### Standalone Usage

Hooks work without a provider too:

```tsx
// No WalletProvider needed
const { balances } = useStellarBalances(publicKey, {
  horizonUrl: 'https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org',
});
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Loading States

All hooks provide consistent loading and error states:

```tsx
const { data, loading, error, refresh } = useSomeHook();

if (loading) return <Spinner />;
if (error) return <button onClick={refresh}>Retry</button>;
return <DisplayData data={data} />;
```

### XDR Building Pattern

Transaction hooks follow a consistent pattern for wallet integration:

```tsx
// 1. Build unsigned XDR
const xdr = await buildPaymentXDR({ from, to, amount });

// 2. Sign with external wallet (Freighter, etc.)
const signedXdr = await wallet.signTransaction(xdr);

// 3. Submit signed transaction
const result = await submitSignedXDR(signedXdr);
```
