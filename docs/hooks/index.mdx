# Hooks Overview

Nextellar provides a set of powerful, typed React hooks that simplify working with Stellar accounts, balances, payments, smart contracts, wallets, and network status.  
These hooks are lightweight, composable, and designed to fit naturally into modern Next.js applications.

---

## Why Hooks in Nextellar?

Using hooks in Nextellar gives you:

### ✅ Reactive Stellar data

Live updates for accounts, balances, transactions, and contract values.

### ✅ Cleaner UI components

Hooks keep UI components free from networking and blockchain logic.

### ✅ Built-in loading & error states

Every hook exposes a consistent, predictable return shape.

### ✅ Full TypeScript support

Strong types for Stellar responses ensure correctness and better DX.

### ✅ Wallet-aware functionality

Hooks automatically detect and respond to wallet connection state.

## How Nextellar Hooks Work

Nextellar’s hooks are designed to stay out of your way and let you build fast. Each hook sits on top of lightweight Stellar utilities and wallet adapters, turning complex blockchain logic into simple, predictable React APIs. Instead of managing network calls, parsing responses, or handling edge cases, you work with clean, focused hooks that compose naturally — so you can spend more time building features and less time wiring things together.
